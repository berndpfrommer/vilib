include(CMakeFindDependencyMacro)

# bring config variables into scope like this:
# set(my-config-var @my-config-var@)

# find_dependency has the same syntax as find_package.
# List all dependencies here so they are exposed to
# the importing package through the vilibConfig.cmake

# CUDA is not a dependency because it is natively
# provided by cmake as language support?
# Either way, there is no cudaConfig right now.

# find_dependency(cuda REQUIRED)

# Add the targets file
